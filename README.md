After a code-along project from Colt Steele's course, I tried to recreate it on my own.

I'm really enjoying teaching myself web development. I love that I've finally found something that blends logic and creativity. My learning technique includes code along projects, but afterward I try and recreate the same project without guidance. 

I know the comments in the CSS aren't helpful -- they're my way of talking myself through the project.

Thanks for looking!
